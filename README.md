# RedOxRI
The new (and maybe improved) version of redoxr! The (Rust) Build system for slightly odd people (just me).

# IMPORTANT

## TODOS
1. Make flags not require recompilation (maybe use statics and lazylock) for better speed
2. Implement a keep function that forces compilation, while still using compile function and its upsides
3. Maybe someday update CMcule and RustMcule
4. Implement isolate feature without it sucking balls
5. Implment Flag Generics so things may share flags without copying them (make em constant)
