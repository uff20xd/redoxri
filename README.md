# RedOxRI
The new (and maybe improved) version of redoxr! The (Rust) Build system for slightly odd people (just me).

## TODOS
1. Implement a keep function that forces compilation, while still using compile function and its upsides
2. Maybe someday update CMcule and RustMcule
3. Make outpath and name public
4. Impement isolate feature without it sucking balls
5. Implment Flag Generics so things may share flags without copying them (make em constant)
